# Prototyping - Iteration 1
## Sketches
In this section, we are going to make **2** sketches with Invision App.

### Sketches with Invision (Low Fidelity)
- Sketches 1 (Low Fidelity - 1)

- Sketches 2 (Low Fidelity - 2)

### Version Differences
- Sketch 1 :
  In this solution, we completely redesigned the MonTA user interface, starting from the placement of input search, search filters, table columns, and others.

- Sketch 2 :
  In this solution, we only redesigned the UI placement on the old MonTA website.

### Selected Sketch
We prefer solution 1 as the selected sketch. Because the design is simple, easy to be implemented, eye-catching, intuitive, and informative.

### Design Rationale
The main problem with the original website is the limited search capability, which sometimes can make someone frustated while using it. Therefore, we are trying to design a system with a better search capability.
