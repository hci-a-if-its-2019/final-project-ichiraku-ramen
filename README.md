# Project Topic : Redesigning monTA (Monitoring Tugas Akhir)
## System Description
![HomePage-Monta](img/HomePage.png)
As an undergraduate in Indonesia, especially in Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember Surabaya, an undergraduate is expected to complete a final assignment, or thesis, to complete their bachelor's degree. A series of steps should be conducted in order to complete this assignment, from the initial proposal of a thesis to the final thesis presentation. This series of steps, however, must be documented and monitored properly in order to properly finish the assignment.  

MonTA *(Monitoring Tugas Akhir)* is a system designed for monitoring the progress of an undergraduate's thesis. The system acts as a platform for students and lecturers to directly monitor their progress on completing their theses. The system also provides a platform for lecturers to promote their research that a student may take in order to complete their thesis.

## What's Bad About The Existing System
Our team have found some problems in the existing system. The first one is about finding information about theses in the system. The current system only provides a limited search capability that does not cover all of the needed information nowdays. The second one is the outdated user interface. The user interface, while functionally sufficient, does not provide a good experience for the users, especially for the first timers.

In this final project, our teams will look out for the main problems that causes the observations above and propose a solution that hopefully may fix the current problem.
